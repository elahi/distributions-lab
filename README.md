## Lab: Exploring Statistical Distributions

This is an R Shiny app, developed for Stanford's Quantitative Methods in Marine Ecology and Conservation course, in which students explore various statistical distributions used in ecology by plotting those distributions for a range of parameters, drawing samples from the distributions, and then plotting the distribution of sample means.

In order to launch the app, download and unzip this repository, open `distributions-lab.Rproj` to open a new RStudio session, and then load `app.R` and click the "Run App" button in RStudio. You may need to first install the R packages `tidyverse` and `shiny`.
